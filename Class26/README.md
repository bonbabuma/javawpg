## Homework

* Plan out the tables that you will need to create for your application. These tables should very closely match the classes that you created earlier for the data that you plan to store.
  * If you have classes that would contain other classes, such as users that can sell different products, you may need to introduce primary and foreign keys to your tables in order to link different tables together.
* Download and install either MySQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.
* Create a new database for your application.
* Create the tables that you will need to store the data for your application.
* Populate some dummy data into your database for testing.
